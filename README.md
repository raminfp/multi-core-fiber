# Multi-Core-Fiber

## Project Description

A high-performance, multi-core Go web application built with Fiber, designed to leverage advanced concurrency patterns and maximize computational efficiency across multiple CPU cores.

## Concurrency and Multi-Core Architecture

### Go's Concurrency Model
Go's runtime provides a powerful concurrency model built on goroutines - lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. Unlike traditional threading models, goroutines are extremely efficient, allowing thousands of concurrent operations with minimal overhead.

### Multi-Core Optimization Strategies

#### 1. Runtime Core Utilization
The application automatically optimizes CPU core usage through:
- Dynamic detection of available CPU cores
- Intelligent distribution of computational workloads
- Maximizing system resources with `runtime.GOMAXPROCS()`

#### 2. Concurrent Request Handling
- Each incoming HTTP request is processed in its own goroutine
- Fiber framework inherently supports concurrent request processing
- Automatic load balancing across available CPU cores

### Performance Characteristics

**Concurrency Benefits:**
- Minimal context-switching overhead
- Efficient resource allocation
- Horizontal scaling capabilities
- Near-linear performance scaling with additional cores

### Key Concurrency Techniques

1. **Goroutine-Based Concurrency**
    - Lightweight thread management
    - Automatic scheduling by Go runtime
    - Low memory footprint compared to traditional threads

2. **Connection Pooling**
    - Efficient management of database and cache connections
    - Distributed across multiple cores
    - Reduced connection establishment overhead

3. **Non-Blocking I/O**
    - Asynchronous handling of network and database operations
    - Prevents thread blocking during long-running tasks
    - Maximizes system throughput

## Multi-Core Configuration

```go
// Core optimization example
numCores := runtime.NumCPU()
runtime.GOMAXPROCS(numCores)
```

This configuration:
- Automatically detects available CPU cores
- Sets maximum parallel execution threads
- Ensures optimal resource utilization

### Comparative Performance

| Configuration | Single Core | Multi-Core |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Request Handling | Sequential | Concurrent |
| CPU Utilization | Limited | Maximized |
| Scalability | Low | High |

## Core Design Principles

- **Efficiency**: Minimize computational waste
- **Scalability**: Adapt to varying system capabilities
- **Resilience**: Graceful handling of concurrent operations

## Advanced Concurrency Patterns

- Channel-based communication
- Context-driven goroutine management
- Atomic operations for thread-safe interactions

## Monitoring and Observability

Integrated monitoring provides insights into:
- Goroutine lifecycle
- Core utilization
- Performance bottlenecks
- Real-time error tracking with Sentry

## When to Use Multi-Core Fiber

Ideal for:
- High-traffic web services
- Compute-intensive applications
- Microservices architectures
- Real-time data processing systems

## Performance Considerations

While multi-core configuration offers significant benefits, actual performance gains depend on:
- Workload characteristics
- I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound tasks
- Specific application design


## Limitations and Considerations

- Not all operations benefit equally from parallelization
- Overhead in managing very fine-grained concurrency
- Potential increased memory consumption

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.23+
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- Sentry account (optional)

## Configuration

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure environment variables:
    - Database connection strings
    - Redis settings
    - Sentry DSN
    - Other service-specific configurations
